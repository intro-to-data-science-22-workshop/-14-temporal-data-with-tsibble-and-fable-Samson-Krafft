# Temporal data with tsibble and fable


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to tidy temporal data and tidy forecasting with fable. Forecasting based on temporal data is highly important for many areas of policy-making and business and thus a highly relevant skill for a data scientist. While tsibble provides the data structure based on the principles of tidy data, fable is a complementary package that uses tsibble objects and allows us to specify models to create forecasts. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) equip you with conceptual knowledge about temporal data and the tsibble package, (2) show you a forecasting workflow using fable, and (3) provide you with a hands-on exercise to allow you to apply your tsibble and fable skills. 

For those who are keen to learn more, please check out the list of further resources.
